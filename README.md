## Building

You'll need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) installed on your computer in order to build this application.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tonton-pixel/color-ramp-formulator
cd color-ramp-formulator
npm install
npm start
```

If you don't wish to clone, you can [download the source code](https://github.com/tonton-pixel/color-ramp-formulator/archive/master.zip).

Several scripts are also defined in the `package.json` file to build OS-specific bundles of the app, using the simple yet powerful [Electron Packager](https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-packager) Node module.\
For instance, running the following command will create a `Color Ramp Formulator.app` version for macOS:

```bash
npm run build-darwin
```
